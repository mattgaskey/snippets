# Cell Mitosis

A p5.js simulation of cell mitosis with generative mutations.  A set of controls allows for real-time updating of mutation parameters:

* Mutation: chances that a cell division will result in a mutation

* Intensity: amplitude of mutation

* Vitality: determines whether a mutation is more or less likely to survive

* Population: max total cells in the window
